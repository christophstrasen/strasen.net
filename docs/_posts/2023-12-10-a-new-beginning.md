I was 12 when I built my first website and uploaded gif-flickering pages about chatting, music, fantasy and star wars to xoom.com (RIP).

With this gentle return to internet publishing I intend to _experiment_ with sharing limited updates on topics such as tech, business, general thoughts and the occasional private post.

Lets see how it goes.
